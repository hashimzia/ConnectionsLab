# Room View
## The Idea
After looking at all the libraries, three.js was the one that interested me the most. Not only is it really powerful but it allows for an almost endless amount of opportunities to be created through it

## Room view 
The application currently uses a scan of my room created by my phone's camera and an application that converts that into a 3d model. The idea is to be able to show my room to anyone in the world just by giving them a link to my website.

## Why room view and what makes it unique
Currently the website only works as a 3d model viewer with very few basic controls to be able to look around.
This can be achieved with any 3d model viewer and hence is not the end product of this assignment.
The idea is to create a website that can use three.js models and then incorporate some of three.js's unique features to be able to make it interactive. For example the items in my room can be made highlightable and then more information can show up about them specifically, in a augmented/virtual reality sort of a way.
Another idea that I am really inclined towards is to use three.js to create a 3d game version of a project I have already created. The hide and seek game created in assignment 2 can be enhanced infinitely (in my opinion) if it can be played in a room that is 3d scanned and then using three.js's abilities to implement all the features of assignment 2 into a 3d game.
